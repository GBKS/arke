# Project Documentation

Welcome to the project documentation. This documentation is organized to help you understand the system architecture, features, and development workflows.

**The docs are created and maintained by AI, mostly for its own use. As the project grows, it can reference basic architectural decisions, etc. In reverse, make sure to tell AI to revise docs as needed.**

## 📋 Documentation Structure

### 🏗️ Architecture
Core system design and component relationships:
- [System Overview](system-overview.md) - High-level architecture and component responsibilities
- [Data Flow](data-flow.md) - How data moves through the system
- [Service Layer](service-layer.md) - Core services and their interfaces

### ⚡ Features
Detailed implementation guides for major features:
- [Balance Persistence](balance-persistence.md) - SwiftData persistence for Ark and Onchain balances

### 📚 API Reference
Technical reference for services and models:
- [Model Definitions](model-definitions.md) - Data models and transformations

### 🗂️ Archive
Historical implementation and migration documentation:
- [Migration History](MIGRATION_HISTORY.md) - Summary of all completed migrations
- Individual migration files preserved for reference

## 🚀 Quick Start

New to the project? Start with:
1. [System Overview](system-overview.md) - Understand the big picture
2. [Service Layer](service-layer.md) - Learn the core services
3. [Model Definitions](model-definitions.md) - Understand data structures

## 📝 Contributing to Documentation

This documentation follows a consistent structure:
- **Overview**: Brief description of the system/feature
- **Implementation Details**: Technical specifics with code examples
- **Benefits**: User experience and performance improvements
- **Architecture Consistency**: How it fits with existing patterns

When adding new documentation, use the existing balance persistence document as a template for structure and detail level.

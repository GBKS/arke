# Features Documentation

This section contains detailed implementation guides for major application features. Each document follows a consistent structure that explains both the technical implementation and the reasoning behind design decisions.

## Documents

- **balance-persistence.md** - SwiftData persistence implementation for Ark and Onchain balance caching

## Documentation Template

Each feature document includes:
- **Overview**: What the feature does and why it exists
- **Implementation Details**: Technical specifics with code examples
- **Benefits**: User experience, performance, and reliability improvements
- **Architecture Consistency**: How the feature maintains patterns established elsewhere

## Purpose

These documents serve as both implementation guides and historical records of design decisions. They help maintain consistency across features and provide context for future modifications.

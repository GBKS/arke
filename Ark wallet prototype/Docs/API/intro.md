# API Reference Documentation

This section provides technical reference materials for the application's services, models, and interfaces.

## Documents

- **service-interfaces.md** - Public interfaces, key methods, and protocols for core services
- **model-definitions.md** - Data models, their relationships, and transformation patterns

## Purpose

These documents serve as quick reference materials for developers working with the codebase. They focus on the "what" and "how" of the public interfaces, complementing the architectural documentation that explains the "why".

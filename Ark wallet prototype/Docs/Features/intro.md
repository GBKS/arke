# Features Documentation

This section contains detailed implementation guides for major application features. Each document follows a consistent structure that explains both the technical implementation and the reasoning behind design decisions.

## Current Features

- **[balance-persistence.md](balance-persistence.md)** - SwiftData persistence implementation for Ark and Onchain balance caching
- **[tag-system.md](tag-system.md)** - Complete transaction tagging and organization system with SwiftData relationships

## Documentation Template

Each feature document includes:
- **Overview**: What the feature does and why it exists
- **Architecture**: Technical design and component relationships  
- **Implementation Details**: Code examples and integration patterns
- **Benefits**: User experience, performance, and reliability improvements
- **Architecture Consistency**: How the feature maintains patterns established elsewhere

## Purpose

These documents serve as both implementation guides and architectural references. They help maintain consistency across features and provide context for future modifications and enhancements.

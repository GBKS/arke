# Address History Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 1: Data Models (100% Complete)
- ✅ **AddressType.swift** - Enum for address types (ark/onchain)
- ✅ **AddressGenerationStrategy.swift** - Generation strategy enum
- ✅ **PersistentAddress.swift** - SwiftData model with all properties
- ✅ **AddressErrors.swift** - Error types (gap limit, duplicates)
- ✅ **Arke_mobile.swift** - Added PersistentAddress to ModelContainer
- ✅ **PersistentTransaction.swift** - Added `receivingAddress` relationship

### Phase 2: AddressService (100% Complete)
- ✅ **AddressService.swift** - Completely rewritten with:
  - Address history tracking (no more always-new addresses)
  - `getCurrentReceiveAddress()` - Smart address retrieval
  - `generateNewAddress()` - User-requested generation with policies
  - `isOwnAddress()` - Internal transfer detection
  - `markAddressAsUsed()` - Usage tracking
  - `getAddressByString()` - Public helper for transaction linking
  - Gap limit enforcement (max 20 unused onchain)
  - Derivation index tracking
  - Database query helpers
- ✅ **WalletManager.swift** - Already initializes AddressService with ModelContext

### Phase 2.5: Transaction Model Extensions (100% Complete)
- ✅ **PersistentTransaction.swift** - Added internal transfer detection:
  - `receivingAddress` relationship property
  - `isInternalTransfer` computed property
  - `effectiveType` computed property
  - `effectiveTypeDisplayName` display helper
  - `effectiveTypeIcon` SF Symbol helper

## 🔧 IN PROGRESS

### Phase 3: Transaction-Address Integration (50% Complete)

**What's Done:**
- ✅ Data models support linking
- ✅ AddressService has all necessary methods
- ✅ Helper method `getAddressByString()` is public

**What's Needed:**
- 🔧 Find where transactions are created/processed
- 🔧 Add address linking logic for received transactions
- 🔧 Add internal transfer detection for sent transactions
- 🔧 Pass AddressService to TransactionService

**See `../Archive/Implementations/Address history/PHASE_3_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for detailed instructions.**

## 📋 TODO

### Phase 4: UI Updates (Not Started)

**Receive View:**
- Update to use `getCurrentReceiveAddress()` instead of `loadAddresses()`
- Add "Generate New Address" button
- Show address usage indicator ("Unused" or "Used X times")
- Add gap limit warning alert

**Transaction List (Optional):**
- Show internal transfer icon/label differently
- Use `transaction.effectiveTypeIcon` and `effectiveTypeDisplayName`
- Orange color for internal transfers

**Settings (Optional):**
- Simple address history list
- Show all generated addresses
- Display: address, type, used/unused, date

### Phase 5: Testing (Not Started)

- Test gap limit enforcement
- Test address reuse (Ark vs onchain)
- Test internal transfer detection
- Test derivation index tracking
- Test wallet restoration scenarios
- Performance testing with many addresses

## 🎯 Current Focus: Phase 3

**Next Immediate Steps:**

1. **Find TransactionService** - Locate where transactions are created
   - Look for `TransactionService.swift`
   - Method: `refreshTransactions()` or `loadTransactions()`
   - Where `PersistentTransaction` objects are instantiated

2. **Add Address Linking** - In transaction processing:
   ```swift
   // For received transactions:
   if transaction.type == "received", let address = transaction.address {
       await addressService.markAddressAsUsed(address: address, transaction: transaction)
       transaction.receivingAddress = await addressService.getAddressByString(address)
   }
   
   // For sent transactions (internal transfer detection):
   if transaction.type == "sent", let address = transaction.address {
       if await addressService.isOwnAddress(address) {
           transaction.subsystemCategory = "internal_transfer"
           transaction.receivingAddress = await addressService.getAddressByString(address)
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Wire AddressService** - Pass to TransactionService
   - Add `setAddressService()` method to TransactionService
   - Call it in `WalletManager.setModelContext()`

4. **Test** - Verify address linking works:
   - Receive funds → address marked as used
   - Send to own address → detected as internal
   - Send to external → not detected as internal

## 🔍 How to Find Transaction Processing

Try searching for these files/patterns in your codebase:

1. **File search:**
   - `TransactionService.swift`
   - Files with "Transaction" in the name

2. **Code search:**
   - `class TransactionService`
   - `PersistentTransaction(txid:`
   - `refreshTransactions`
   - `loadTransactions`
   - `modelContext.insert(transaction`

3. **In WalletManager:**
   - Look at `transactionService?.refreshTransactions()` call (line 599)
   - Follow that to find the actual implementation

## 🚀 Benefits Already Available

Even though Phase 3 isn't complete, you already have:

1. **Address History System** ✅
   - All addresses tracked in database
   - Proper gap limit enforcement
   - Derivation index tracking for recovery

2. **Smart Address Generation** ✅
   - Ark addresses reused (efficient)
   - Onchain addresses follow best practices
   - Never exceeds gap limit

3. **Internal Transfer Detection Ready** ✅
   - `isOwnAddress()` method works
   - `isInternalTransfer` property available
   - Just needs to be wired up to transaction processing

4. **Future-Proof Foundation** ✅
   - CloudKit sync ready
   - Extensible for advanced features
   - Follows your existing patterns

## 💡 Quick Win

You could test the address history system right now without Phase 3:

```swift
// In a test view or debug screen:
Task {
    // Generate some addresses
    let arkAddr = try await addressService.getCurrentReceiveAddress(type: .ark)
    print("Ark: \(arkAddr.address)")
    
    let btcAddr = try await addressService.getCurrentReceiveAddress(type: .onchain)
    print("BTC: \(btcAddr.address)")
    
    // See all addresses
    let all = await addressService.getAllAddresses()
    print("Total addresses: \(all.count)")
    
    // Check gap limit
    let unused = await addressService.getUnusedAddressCount(type: .onchain)
    print("Unused onchain: \(unused)/20")
}
```

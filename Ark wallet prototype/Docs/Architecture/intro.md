# Architecture Documentation

This section contains high-level architectural documentation that explains how the major components of the system work together.

## Documents

- **system-overview.md** - High-level architecture, component responsibilities, and system boundaries
- **data-flow.md** - How data flows through the application from external sources to UI
- **service-layer.md** - Core services, their responsibilities, and interaction patterns

## Purpose

These documents provide the foundational understanding needed to work effectively with the codebase. They focus on the "why" behind architectural decisions and the relationships between major system components.

# Migration History Summary

This document provides a consolidated overview of all major architectural migrations and implementations completed in the project.

## Completed Migrations

### 1. Transaction Architecture Migration
**File:** `ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION.md`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Summary:** Migrated from dual-model transaction architecture to unified TransactionModel with SwiftData. Eliminated random UUIDs, implemented stable server-derived IDs, and enabled direct UI observation. Foundation for tagging system.

### 2. Ark Balance Model Unification  
**File:** `ARK_BALANCE_MIGRATION.md`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Summary:** Migrated from dual-model architecture (struct + PersistedArkBalance) to unified @Model class. Eliminated conversion overhead, simplified service layer, and enabled direct SwiftData observation.

### 3. Onchain Balance Model Unification
**File:** `ONCHAIN_BALANCE_MIGRATION.md` 
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Summary:** Migrated from dual-model architecture to unified @Model class matching Ark balance pattern. Consistent architecture across all balance types.

### 4. Tag System Implementation (4-Step Process)

#### Step 1: SwiftData Tag Models
**File:** `STEP1_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Summary:** Created PersistentTag and TransactionTagAssignment models with junction table approach. Established foundation for many-to-many tag relationships.

#### Step 2: TagService Implementation
**File:** `STEP2_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Summary:** Implemented comprehensive TagService with CRUD operations, tag assignment logic, task deduplication, and default tag creation. Follows existing service patterns.

#### Step 3: WalletManager Integration
**File:** `STEP3_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Summary:** Integrated TagService into WalletManager using coordinator pattern. Added computed properties, delegation methods, and SwiftUI environment injection support.

#### Step 4: Tag Preservation During Server Refreshes
**File:** `STEP4_TAG_PRESERVATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Summary:** Enhanced TransactionService upsert logic to preserve tag assignments during server data updates. Added orphaned transaction handling and comprehensive monitoring.

## Current System State

After all migrations:
- **Unified Model Architecture**: All data types (Transaction, Ark, Onchain) use single @Model classes
- **Complete Tag System**: Full CRUD, assignment, preservation, and management capabilities
- **Consistent Service Patterns**: All services follow same architectural patterns with TaskDeduplicationManager
- **SwiftData Integration**: Complete persistence layer with relationship management
- **Modern Swift Patterns**: Async/await, @Observable, SwiftUI environment injection

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: All data models and services follow unified patterns
2. **Performance**: Eliminated dual-model conversion overhead across the system
3. **Reliability**: Tag assignments survive server updates automatically
4. **Maintainability**: Clear service separation and coordinator patterns
5. **Extensibility**: Foundation ready for CloudKit sync and additional features
6. **UI Integration**: Direct SwiftData observation enables automatic UI updates

## Key Technical Learnings

- **SwiftData Relationships**: Junction table approach provides better control than direct @Relationship arrays
- **Unified Models**: Single @Model classes with custom Codable implementation work well for API + persistence
- **Coordinator Pattern**: WalletManager delegation scales effectively for multiple specialized services
- **Explicit Preservation**: Even with automatic relationship handling, explicit logging provides confidence
- **Task Deduplication**: Essential for preventing concurrent operations in observable services

## Database Schema Evolution

```
Initial: TransactionModel (UUID) + Separate Balance Structs
    ↓
Unified: TransactionModel (@Model, stable IDs) + Unified Balance Models  
    ↓
Tagged: + PersistentTag + TransactionTagAssignment (Junction Table)
    ↓
Complete: Server-refresh-safe with preserved relationships
```
